This project was created during my **first Full Stack Development Workshop**.  
Itâ€™s a basic Smart City application that helped me understand how **frontend and backend** fit together.

## Key Learnings 
- Understood the role of **frontend vs backend**  
- Practiced React concepts: props, `useEffect`, map/forEach  
- Gained hands-on experience with debugging and project setup

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- Future scope: database integration with MongoDB/MySQL,build more UI features 


## Notes 
This repo is my starting point in full stack development.  
It may not be perfect, but it marks the beginning of my journey
